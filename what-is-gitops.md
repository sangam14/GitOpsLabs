# What is GitOps ?

GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery, it works by using Git as a source of truth for declarative infrastructure and workloads. 
For Kubernetes this means using `git push` instead of `kubectl create/apply` or `helm install/upgrade`.

# What is Progressive Delivery?

Progressive delivery is an umbrella term for advanced deployment patterns like canaries, 
feature flags and A/B testing. Progressive delivery techniques are used to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by giving app developers and SRE teams a fine-grained control over the blast radius.
